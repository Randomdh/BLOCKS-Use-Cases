# BLOCKS-Use-Cases

Here's a brief overview of how this smart contract works:

A client creates a new escrow agreement by calling the createEscrow function and providing the required parameters (freelancer's address, arbitrator's address, and the amount of BLOCKS to be held in escrow).

The client then transfers the agreed-upon amount of BLOCKS to the escrow contract by calling the transfer function on the BLOCKS contract.

The freelancer completes the agreed-upon work and calls the releaseFunds function to release the BLOCKS from escrow to their own address.

If there is a dispute, the arbitrator can be called upon to resolve it by calling the arbitrate function and specifying the winning party (either the client or freelancer).

If the freelancer fails to complete the work or if the arbitrator rules in favor of the client, the client can call the cancelEscrow function to cancel the agreement and retrieve their BLOCKS from escrow.

Note that this smart contract is BLOCKS specific, meaning that only the BLOCKS token can be used for the escrow transactions. Additionally, the smart contract is designed to allow any number of clients, freelancers, and arbitrators to use it, so it can be scaled to handle multiple escrow agreements simultaneously.
